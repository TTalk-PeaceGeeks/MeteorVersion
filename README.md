# Tea Time
Meteor Version''

##Problem
When newcomers (refugees) come to Vancouver, Canada it can be difficult to intergrate into Canadian culture and society. The newcomers might have had a lot of traumatic experiences which makes it hard to reach out to locals, especially if they don't feel secure about the locals' willingness to socialize with them. As the newcomers adapt to their new environment and lifestyle, they might miss the opportunity of talking, asking locals about ordenairy things like: "Can you recommend a dentist?"
On the other side
Local people are at the moment signing up for programs to help newcomers intergrate. This puts increasing pressure on the volunteer system to facilitate meetings/introductions. Because of the time the organisation needs to faclitate the meeting/introductions, locals are growing impatient. They don't see a outcome of their input (signing up).

##Solution
By creating this platfrom we're creating a space for locals to actively make inputs and clearly see the outcome. The newcomers have a place where they can get in contact with locals who want to help/spend time with them.

## Purpose
The Tea Time app is a platform with 2 angles.
1. It's for newcomers to meet and interact with locals. This will create a warm space where connections can be made, which otherwise would have been hard to establish for the newcomers.
2. For the locals (Vancouverites) it creates a space where they actively can reach out to the newcomers and build bridges for people who wants to intergrate in the Canadian society. It benefits the locals because they can make a  impact and have more control over their volunteer work.

##Platforms
We're doing android, ios and web applications.
The andoid and ios is to meet the locals at their eyelevel. The web aplication is to ensure that newcomers who might not have a computer, tablet or smartphone, still can engage on the platform. 

##Wireframes / Paper Prototype

1. Choose language. This will help us identify if they're newcomers or locals. But as well take into account that newcomers might not speak english, and need their app to be in their language for it to be useful.
2. Profile setup. Here we get information from the users (* = mandatory), profile picture, sex*, name/nickname*, email*, neigbourghood, bio.

3. Map. Here they can see people who are offering or wanting activities. They can see it as a list view & they can create a offer or want.
4. List view. Here they can see a list of the events that are postet. They can comment and create dialog with the person who created the event.
5. Create Event. Event name, picture URL, location, event date, cost.
(6.) Chat. Make it possible for people to chat with each other about the event. This creates a space where people can get in touch on a more personal level and feel more secure.
(7.) Notifications. Here people can get notified if somebody commented on their event.
(8.) Review. On people's profile you can go in and review them.

###Todo:
1. Get a list of the laguages newcomers will be speaking/reading.
1. Get a list of languages locals will be speaking/reading.
2. Work on how they put in their neighbourhood. Is it a textfield, a zip code, a map where they point out their neighboorhood or?? There's a lot of opportunities and it should take peoples privacy into account, but also newcomers lack of knowledge about the area they've moved to.
- Create boards where people can make queries and discuss subejcts eg. "Did you know that it's legally required to wear a helmet when biking?"

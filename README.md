# Tea Time
Meteor Version''

##Problem
When newcomers (refugees) comes to Canada, Vancouver it can be difficult to intergrate with the Canadian cultur and society. The newcomers might have had a lot of traumatic experiences which makes it hard to reacht out to locals. Especially if they don't feel secure about the locals willingness to socialize with them. As the newcomers adapt more to their new environment and lifestyle, they might miss the opportunity of talking, asking locals about ordenairy things like: "Can you recommend a dentist?"
On the other side
Local people are at the moment signing up for programs to help newcomers intergrate. This put's an increasing pressure on the volunteer system to facilitate these meeting/introducations. Because the organisations needs to faclitate the meeting/introductions, locals are growing impatiente. They don't see a outcome of their input (signing up)

##Solution
By creating this platfrom we're creating a space for locals to actively make inputs and clearly see the outcome. The newcomers have a place where they can get in contact with locals who wants to help/spend time with them.

## Purpose
The Tea Time app is a platform with 2 angles.
1. It's for newcomers to meet and interact with the locals. This will create a warm space where connections can be made, which otherwise would have been hard to establish for the newcomers.
2. For the locals (Vancouverites) it creates a space where they actively can reach out to the newcomers and build bridges for people who wants to intergrate in the Canadian society. It benefits the locals because they can make a  impact and have more control over their volunteer work.

1. Choose language. This will help us identify if they're newcomers or locals. But as well take into account that newcomers might not speak english
